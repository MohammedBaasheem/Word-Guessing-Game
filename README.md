# Word Guessing Game

## Game Idea
The Word Guessing Game is an interactive game where the player is asked to guess letters in a randomly chosen word from a predefined list. The goal is to uncover the entire word before running out of attempts.

## How to Play
1. When the player starts the game, they are prompted to enter their name.
2. A random word is selected from a list of words (such as "PYTHON", "JAVA", "SWIFT", etc.).
3. A series of dashes "-" is displayed, representing the number of letters in the word.
4. The player is allowed to guess one letter per turn.
5. If the guessed letter is in the word, the corresponding dash is replaced with the correct letter.
6. The game continues until the player successfully uncovers the word or runs out of attempts.

## Rules
- If the word has 4 letters or fewer, the player gets attempts equal to the length of the word + 2.
- If the word has 5 to 7 letters, the player gets attempts equal to the length of the word + 3.
- If the word has more than 7 letters, the player gets attempts equal to the length of the word + 4.
